Disclaimer: This project does not fully work. A result cannot be achieved, nor can the text on the buttons change. I am greatly apoligetic for the terrible state this project is left in.

Step 1: Download all of the files from the repository.
Step 2: Put all of these files in a folder and title it "GeoDialect".
Step 3: Go to the Command Prompt and type "py - m pip install pillow"
Step 4: Try to use the program to the best of your ability.
